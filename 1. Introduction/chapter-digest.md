# Chapter 1: Introduction

This chapter explains the importance of the analysis of algorithms, their notations and relationships.

## Variables
These are basically boxes that hold values in them. Or these are placeholders for actual data.

## Data Types
Data types as the name suggests, are the type of data that are predefined in a programming language.
For example: integer, floating point, character, string (group of characters) etc.
Each data type takes a fixed amount of computer memory. For example integer (depends on the compiler) takes 2 bytes (16  bits), float takes 4 byts (32 bits) and so on. 

At the top level, there are two types of data types:
- System-defined data types (Premitive data types)
- User-defined data types

### System-defined data types (Primitive data types)
These are the data types that are defined by the system. The very common data types that are provided by many programming languages are: int, float, char, double, bool, etc. 
The memory allocated for each primitive data type depends on the programming language, the compiler and the operating system.

### User defined data types
Most programming languages allow userd to define their own data types and these are called user defined data types.
For example, structures in C/C++ and classes in Java.

Below is an example of user defined data type (struct) in C. This gives more flexibility and comfort in dealing with computer memory.
```c 
struct newType{
    int data1;
    fload data2;
    chat data;
};
```

## Data Structures
Okay so now we have data. But we need a way to store and organize it in a way so that it can be used efficiently and `data structure` is that way!

> A data structure is a special format for organizing and storing data.

General data structure types include: arrays, files, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs and so on.

Depending on the organizations of the elements, data structures can be classified into two types:
1. Linear data structures: ELements are *accessed* in a sequential order (not compulsory to store sequentially). eg: LInked Lists, Stacks and Queues.
2. Non-Linear data structures: Elements of this data structures are stores/accessed in a non-linear order. Examples: Trees and graphs.

## Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
Data Stuctures with their operations combined is called Abstract Data Types (ADTs). So ADT consists of two parts:

1. Declaration of data.
2. Declaration of operations.

Commonly used ADTs include: Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Priority Queues, Binary Trees, Dictionaries, Disjoint Sets (Union Find), Hash Tables, Graphs, and many others.

For example, stack uses LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) mechanism while storing data. The last element inserted into the stack is the first element that gets deleted. Common operations on stack: Creations, pushing element to stack, popping element from the stack, finding the current top of the stack, finding number of elements in the stack, etc.

## What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a step by step **unambiguous** instructions to solve a given problem.
There are two main criteria for judging the merits of algorithms:
- Correctness: does the algorithm give a solution to the problem?
- Efficiency: how much resources (time and memory) does it take to execute?

## Why the Analysis of Algorithms?
This helps us to determine which algorithm is most efficient in terms of time and space consumed.

## What is Running Time Analysis?
It is the process of determining how processing time increases as the size of the problem (input size) increases. The input size is the number of elements in the input.
The following are the common type of inputs:
- Size of an array.
- Polynomial degree
- Number of elements in a matrix
- Number of bits in a binary representation of the input
- Vertices and edges in a graph.

## How to Compare Algorithms
To compare algorithms, let us define a few objective measures:

**Execution times?** Not a good measure as these are specific to a particular computer.

**Number of statements executed?** Not a good measure, since the number of statements varies with the programming language as well as style of indicidual programmer.

**Ideal solution?** Let us assume that we express the running time of a given algorithm as a function of the input size n (i.e., *f*(n)) and compare these different functions corresponding to running time. This kind of comparison is independent of machine time, programming style, etc.

## What is Rate of Growth?
The rate at which the running time increases as a function of input is called rate of growth.
Let us assume that you go to a shot to buy a car and a bicycle. If someone asks you what are you buying? You'd say you are buying a car (in general), just because cost of car is much more than the bicycle.

We can represent the cost of car and bicycle as functions(f(n)) and neglect those that are insignificant (for larger values of n). As an example, in the case below, n<sup>4</sup>, 2n<sup>2</sup>, 100n and 500 are individual costs of some function and approximate to n<sup>4</sup> since n<sup>4</sup>is the highest rate of growth.

> n<sup>4</sup> + 2n<sup>2</sup> + 100n + 500 = n<sup>4</sup>

## Commonly Used Rates of Growth

| :-------------: | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
|        1        | Constant           | Adding an element to the front of a linked list.    |
|        n        | Logarithmic        | Finding element in a sorted array                   |
|      nlogn      | Linear             | Finding element in an unsorted array                |
|      logn       | Linear Logarithmic | Sorting n items by 'divide and conquer' - Mergesort |
|  n<sup>2</sup>  | Quadratic          | Shortest path between two nodes in a graph          |
|  n<sup>3</sup>  | Cubic              | Matrix multiplication                               |
|  2<sup>n</sup>  | Exponential        | The Towers of Hanoi problem                         |

## Types of Analysis
We saw that we can express algorithms in form of an expression. That means we represent the algorithm with multiple expressions: one for the case where it takes less time and another for the case where it takes more time.

First one is **The Best case** and the second one is **The worst case**

There are three types of analysis:
- **Worst case**
  - Defines the input for which the algorithm takes a long time (slowest time to complete) 
  - Input is the one for which the algorithm runs the slowest
- **Best case**
  - Defines the input for which the algorithm takes the least time (fastest time to complete).
  - Input is the one for which algorithm runs the fastest.
- **Average case**
  - Provides a prediction about the running time of the algorithm.
  - Run the algorithm many times, using many different inputs that come from some distribution that generates these inputs, compute the total running time (by adding the individual times), and divide by the number of trials.
  - Assumes that the input is random.


> <center>Lower Bound <= Average Time <= Upper Bound</center>

For a given algorithm, we can represent the best, worst and average cases in the form of expressions. As an example, let f(n) be the function which represents the given algorithm.
> <center>f(n) = n<sup>2</sup> + 500, for worst case</center>
> <center>f(n) = n + 100n + 500, for best case</center>
